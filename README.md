# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### First, after importing all the csv files, I looked at all the tables to see what I would be working with and how I would want to clean the tables to make them more concise and only take what I would need from the tables without altering the raw data.
### Rather than cleaning the data immediately, I went to the questions to see what I would need in order to answer the questions, then I noted down the columns I would need on the side.

## Results
This data gives us information on the site visits and sales on a website. We have information on where the visits are coming from, what they searched for, what they purchased, the time and date, the stock level of each product, product names, etc.
Through using different combinations of these data tables, we found which cities and countries have the highest transaction revenue, the average number of products ordered from each city and country, the types of product from each city and country, the top-selling product from each city and country and the impact of the revenue generated on the website from each city and country.

## Challenges 

I struggled a lot with knowing what to do after exploring the dataset and figuring out how to go about cleaning the dataset, especially removing the duplicates.
I was also unsure with what some of the data was trying to portray, such as the time. It is hard for me to grasp what the time actually represents.
I would often mistaken some of the syntax, like an extra comma or a misplaced parenthesis, so reading through all the errors helped me identify where I went wrong in my query.

## Future Goals

If I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely spend more time sorting through the data and trying to get a more precise and clear structure.
I would also try to understand all the data that is included in the dataset rather than just ignoring the ones that I would not use to answer the questions.
I also think there are some queries I definitely could improve on. For example, using better fit codes/statements in my queries to find a better solution.
