# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### First, after importing all the csv files, I looked at all the tables to see what I would be working with and how I would want to clean the tables to make them more concise and only take what I would need from the tables without altering the raw data.
### Rather than cleaning the data immediately, I went to the questions to see what I would need in order to answer the questions, then I noted down the columns I would need on the side.
### Once

## Results

This data gives us information on 

## Challenges 

I struggled a lot with knowing what to do after exploring the dataset and figuring out how to go about cleaning the dataset, especially removing the duplicates.
I was also unsure with what some of the data was trying to portray, such as the time. It is hard for me to grasp what the time actually represents.
I would often mistaken some of the syntax, like an extra comma or a misplaced parenthesis, so reading through all the errors helped me identify where I went wrong in my query.

## Future Goals

If I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely spend more time sorting through the data and trying to get a more precise and clear structure.
I would also try to understand all the data that is included in the dataset rather than just ignoring the ones that I would not use to answer the questions.
I also think there are some queries I definitely could improve on. For example, using better fit codes/statements in my queries to find a better solution.
